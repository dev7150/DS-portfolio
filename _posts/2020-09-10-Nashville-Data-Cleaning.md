### [Project 2: DataCleaningSQL](https://github.com/dev7150/DataCleaningSQL)


Nashville housing data is used as the data source.
- Date is converted to standard format.
- Remove rows with nulls as property address.
- Use parsename and substring functions to split address into street, state and city.
- Convert 'Y' and 'N' to Yes and No.
- Remove duplicates using CTE.
